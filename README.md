##Purpose: Identify which attributes of MASHABLE articles contribute most to being shared online. 

There are 58 predictive attributes to work with, these include attributes like: 
- Num of words in the title
- Num of words in the content
- Is content about Tech (Business, Social Media etc.)?
- Which weekday was the article published on?
and so on...

##Data Exploration and Cleaning
We found that there were a lot of missing values in the data. To identify the whereabouts of the missing values, we created a heatmap.
